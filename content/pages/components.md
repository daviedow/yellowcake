  Our partner Ana Milena Ortega is a wonderful woman who is passionate about
  coffee, when she speaks you can see the knowledge & love for the land and her
  coffee plantation pouring out.


  She wants to share her coffee with the world, it is an exquisite and delicate high altitude coffee (1,900 meters above sea level) from a micro-farm located in a nature reserve. Bathed by the Campo Alegrito river that flows from the snowy peaks in Santa Rosa de Cabal, Risaralda, Colombia.


  The coffee is washed in the mountain waters, with an advanced ecological system, where its honey and washing residues go to purification tanks and after a while, the earth receives them as a magnificent compost.


  The pulp of this coffee has been sent several times to the United States to make delicious infusions, it was classified among the best 13 farms for its taste and good ecological practices.


  She, together with her partner Patricia CastaÃ±eda, are teachers and work with communities, in addition to taking care of their coffee plantations and the reserve, they have planted more than 4,000 trees during 4 years to develop a project called "A coffee to heal the forest"
