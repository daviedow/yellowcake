# Our Story

I grew up in the tropical paradise that is Cali Colombia, drinking coffee at home, on terraces and with friends. Coffee has always been a big part of my life and has been present in many ways always bringing energy, warmth and passion. When I arrived in the U.K I was forever searching for Colombian coffee everywhere I went but was surprised that it wasn't as popular as I thought it would be. After 2 years I thought it would be nice to share some of the best coffees I had experienced in Colombia with my new home. That was the beginning of this amazing journey. 
I am proud to have introduced coffee into the life of my partner and now we both consider ourselves coffee "aficionados". We want to merge our two worlds and we're super excited to connect the finest green beans Colombia has to offer with the amazing roasters that are in the UK, always with social and environmental impact as a priority.
