I grew up in a tropical paradise drinking coffee on terraces, in homes of friends, while studying and of course working. Coffee has been a big part of my life and has been present in different ways always bringing energy, warmth, passion, and knowledge.  When I arrived in the U.K I was searching for Colombian coffee everywhere. After 2 years I thought it would be nice to share some of the best coffees I had in Colombia with my new home. That was the beginning of this amazing journey. 
I am proud to have introduced coffee into the life of my partner and now we are both coffee aficionados with a passion. in Colombia, happy to share quality,  transparency and create new relationships with coffee farmers to bring the best coffee with social and environmental impact.
